coverage_game
=============

A concept for a game that uses raphael to draw circles of coverage.

There's currently no gameplay. All you can do is place circles over dots, so it's really not interesting.

There are a few different modes (adjustable size circles, connected grids). It does basic checks to see how many circles you are covering.
